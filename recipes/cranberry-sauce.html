    <h1>Cranberry Sauce</h1>
    <img src="Images/thanksgiving-cranberry-sauce-00.jpg" alt="Finished Cranberry Sauce" width=800>
    <h4>This cranberry sauce is a Thanksgiving classic.</h4>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fresh Cranberries</strong> - Opt for fresh cranberries that are firm, plump, and blemish-free. Lighter colored cranberries are best for sauce, as they contain more pectin and result in a thicker consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong> - White sugar does more than add sweetness to classic cranberry sauce: It also absorbs liquid and, when heated, thickens the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Orange Juice</strong> - All cranberry sauce starts with a liquid base. If you don't like orange juice, you can substitute pomegranate juice or even red wine.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve sugar in the orange juice in a medium saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in the cranberries and cook until they start to pop, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and place sauce in a bowl. It will thicken as it cools.</li>
    </ol>
