    <h4>One would think you spent all day in the kitchen when you serve these potatoes as a side dish. Feel free to season the potato filling to your liking.</h4>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 pounds russet baking potatoes</li>
        <li>¼ cup salted butter, melted</li>
        <li>⅓ cup milk</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Wash and scrub potatoes. Place potatoes on the center rack and bake until they are soft in the center, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and cool to the touch, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut potatoes in half and remove potato flesh from the skin, leaving the skin intact. Place potato flesh in a large bowl and beat until fluffy using an electric mixer. Add butter, milk, salt, and pepper and beat until smooth.</li>
        <li>Spoon potato mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large tip and pipe back into the potato skins. Sprinkle with fresh chives. Transfer to freezer bags and freeze until ready to use.</li>
    </ol>
